# Customer_Tracking using Spring MVC & Hibernate 

This project uses Spring Framework along with Hibernate to create a application where customer informations are stored in a database.
Database used is MySQL. 

The user is provided with updating informations on existing customers, deleting customers and adding new Customers. 
Also there is a search box where we can search for a specific cusomer based on its name. 

Here is a screenshot of the main page of the application:
